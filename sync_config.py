# Allowed time window for sync operations (24-hour format)
allowed_start_time = "00:00"  # 10 PM
allowed_end_time   = "00:00"  # 9 AM

# You can change this range to control when sync jobs are allowed to run
# Example use: only allow syncs to run overnight when traffic is low

# Optional future config (not used yet):
# max_retries = 3
# retry_delay_seconds = 30
